                <h2>Risk Screening &amp; Risk/Needs Assessment</h2>
                <p>Assessing the risk of reoffending and intervention needs of youth is considered best practice within certain settings of juvenile justice. NYSAP has the experience and expertise to assist you in implementing a risk screening or risk-needs assessment using risk-need-responsivity-based practices in a manner that meets the needs of your juvenile justice agency and jurisdiction. The cost for our consultation services will vary depending on where your agency is in the process of implementing a risk screening or risk-needs assessment instrument and how many of our services the agency would like to obtain.</p>
                <p>We offer consultation on the implementation process for any evidence-based risk-needs assessment instrument, whether your agency is interested in adopting a risk instrument for the first time or is attempting to improve its existing assessment practices. We review the latest research on the validity of risk-needs assessment instruments for use with different subgroups of youth (e.g., racial groups, youth in different settings) in order to recommend those with the strongest science base.</p>
                <h3>Our Risk Screening and Risk-Needs Assessment Consultation services:</h3>
                <p>We provide the following types of consultation related to implementation of risk screening and risk-needs assessment in multiple settings, including probation or district attorney-based diversion decisions, probation, and correctional settings: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="strong">Determining your Needs: </span>Consultation may include (a) selecting the best risk-needs assessment instrument for your agency and jurisdiction and customizing its use in your agency as needed, or (b) improving use of your existing risk screen or risk-needs assessment instrument.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Implementation With Fidelity:</span> We can assist with the multiple steps involved in implementing risk-needs assessments with fidelity, including but not limited to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Working to obtain stakeholder (e.g., judges, defense attorneys, prosecutors, service agencies) and staff buy-in, including presentations to your stakeholders or advising about strategies for dissemination of information about risk-needs assessment.</li>
                            <li>Preparing policies and procedures and decision-support tools (e.g., case plan, disposition recommendations templates, service matrix) that promote incorporating risk-related needs routinely into agency decision-making.</li>
                            <li>Facilitating pilot testing of the risk-needs or risk screening instrument, new policies and procedures.</li>
                            <li>Determining the necessary data system modifications.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Training at Multiple Levels: </span>A major driver for strong and sustainable implementation is staff and supervisor competency. We provide training at multiple levels, including: <ul>
                            <li>Training and master trainer training for staff on completing specific risk-needs assessment instruments (e.g., the YLS/CMI, the SAVRY) including measures of their proficiency.</li>
                            <li>Training on interviewing youth and families.</li>
                            <li>Training staff on case planning and selecting appropriate services and interventions using risk-need-responsivity principles.</li>
                            <li>Master trainer training on case planning, including measurement of your staff members’ proficiency</li>
                            <li>Supervisor Training</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Quality Control and Continuous Quality Improvement:</span> We provide consultation to help agencies (a) develop quality assurance policies and tools, (b) facilitate on-going quality assurance, and (c) design an on-going data-tracking program.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Sustainability: </span>Once agencies have their assessment and case planning process in place, it is important to support its continued use with fidelity. We can assist with the design of a coaching model for completing the risk-needs assessment and case planning, and development of an assessment or learning community across your agency to continually improve procedures and ensure the assessment and case planning are completed with fidelity.</li>

                <p><span class="bolditalic">The Massachusetts Arrest Screening Tool for Law Enforcement (MASTLE)</span> is an objective screening tool validated in Massachusetts jurisdictions that assesses the likelihood a youth taken into police custody for a criminal offense will be arrested again or will fail to appear for arraignment.
