                                        <p class="card-text medium">Kelly Clement retired in June 2015 from the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice (OJJ) after 28 years of service. He received his Master of Science in Criminal Justice from McNeese State University. He served as the Regional Manager of the New Orleans Regional Office after having risen through the ranks starting as a Probation Officer. Mr. Clement played an integral role in the MacArthur Foundation’s Models for Change reform efforts in Louisiana which focused on the expanding alternatives to formal processing and incarceration, increasing access to evidence‐based services, and reducing disproportionate minority contact with the juvenile justice system. He was the OJJ State Coordinator of their risk/needs assessment implementation, which included policy development, training, and quality improvement. Mr. Clement has served on several Children and Youth Planning Boards, numerous juvenile justice committees, and as an auditor for the American Correctional Association (ACA). He has assisted multiple juvenile justice agencies throughout the country with their risk/needs assessment and risk-need-responsivity implementation efforts. </p>
