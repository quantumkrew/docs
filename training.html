				<h4>MAYSI-2 Training</h4>
				<p>NYSAP provides a customized 2 to 2.5 hour training on the <span class="italic">Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Second Version &#40;MAYSI-2&#41;.</span> The MAYSI-2 provides scores on several mental health problems &#40;including suicide risk&#41; and identifies when a youth needs immediate attention by a mental health professional. The MAYSI-2 was originally developed by NYSAP professionals in 2000. Since then, the MAYSI-2 has become the most widely used mental
					health screening tool nationwide in juvenile justice settings. The training includes an overview of mental health disorders and considerations in adolescents, MAYSI administration and scoring, policies and procedures that will be used by
					your agency, second screening procedures, and how to respond to youth who ‘screen in’. For an overview of the MAYSI-2, go to our <a href="maysi2/index.html" alt="click to go to MAYSI-2 page" title="Maysi2 page">Massachusetts Youth Screening
						Instrument-Second Version &#40;MAYSI-2&#41; page.</a></p>
				<h4>Trauma-Related Screening</h4>
				<p>NYSAP provides training on administration and use of several validated screening tools designed to identify youth who have been exposed to significant trauma and may have serious trauma-related problems. These instruments include the Child
					Trauma Screen &#40;CTS&#41; and the Structured Trauma-related Experiences and Symptoms Screen &#40;STRESS&#41;.</p>
				<h4>Training for Other Professionals</h4>
				<p>NYSAP offers a 1.5 hour orientation training to stakeholders and personnel in the juvenile justice system who may not be administering behavioral health screening tools but who will be making decisions based on them—such community
					child-mental-health providers, lawyers, and judges.</p>

				<h4>Clinician Eligibility Training</h4>
				<p>A two-day, comprehensive training for clinicians designed to prepare them to perform juvenile CST evaluations according to best-practice standards. Includes legal definitions, essential concepts, evaluation procedures and tools,
					interpretation of data, and report writing. NYSAP professionals have published two of the nation’s leading guides for performing juvenile CST evaluations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med:psych/9780195323078.001.0001/med-9780195323078" alt="go to publication" target="_blank">Evaluation of Juveniles' Competence to Stand Trial (Kruh &amp; Grisso, 2009)</a></li>

				</ul>


				<h4>Developmentally-Sensitive Interviewing</h4>
				<p>Half-day or one-day training designed to enhance clinicians’ skills in interviewing adolescents, using a perspective based on youths’ cognitive, psychological and social development across the adolescent age span. This training is
					particularly helpful for clinicians transitioning from adult CST evaluations to juvenile work, as well as for systems with statutes that require developmental sensitivity. This training can be tailored and delivered live to particular
					jurisdictions, agencies and audiences. Alternatively, an on-demand version of this training can be accessed at: <a
						href="https://training.concept.paloaltou.edu/courses/Conceptualizing-and-Applying-Developmental-Immaturity-in-Juvenile-Competence-Evaluations" alt="click to go to page" target="_blank">Conceptualizing and Applying Developmental Immaturity
						in Juvenile Competence Evaluations.</a></p>
				<h4>How to use the JACI</h4>
				<p>The <span class="italic">Juvenile Adjudicative Competence Interview &#40;JACI&#41; </span>currently is the only published, structured assessment tool developed specifically for juvenile CST evaluations. This half-day training provides
					clinicians knowledge and experience for administering and interpreting it. The JACI was developed by NYSAP professionals and is used nationwide. This training can be tailored and delivered live to particular jurisdictions, agencies and
					audiences. Alternatively, an on-demand version of this training can be accessed at: <a href="https://training.concept.paloaltou.edu/courses/Developmentally-Sensitive-Competence-Interviewing-Using-the-JACI" alt="click to go to page"
						target="_blank">Developmentally Sensitive Competence Interviewing Using the JACI</a>.</p>
				<h4>Clinician Advanced Topics</h4>
				<p>Half-day trainings exploring a specific issue in juvenile CST evaluations in greater depth. Examples might include in-depth examination of more complex topics &#40;e.g., evaluating rational appreciation; autism spectrum disorders and
					juvenile CST, etc.&#41;, updates on relevant research to guide evaluations, or specific guidance on report writing or court testimony in juvenile CST evaluations. </p>
				<h4>Juvenile CST for Lawyers/Judges</h4>
				<p>2 to 3-hour trainings designed to allow lawyers and judges to better understand, use and critique clinicians’ juvenile CST evaluations. Includes their legal relevance, requisite clinician expertise, developmental relevance, best evaluation
					procedures, and appropriate and inappropriate interpretations. </p>
				<p>Publications on this topic by NYSAP professionals:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/psych_pp/321/" title="Clinical Evaluations for Juveniles’ Competence to Stand Trial: A Guide for Legal Professionals" alt="go to page" target="_blank">Clinical Evaluations for Juveniles’
							Competence to Stand Trial: A Guide for Legal Professionals (Grisso, 2005)</a></li>

					</li>
				</ul>


				<h4>Juvenile CST for Stakeholders</h4>
				<p>2 to 3-hour trainings for juvenile justice personnel and community child-mental-health providers to help them better understand juvenile CST and its relevance for their work with youths. For a stakeholder’s general overview of juvenile
					CST, see <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjRkq-5_4nsAhWRAZ0JHSgDDLcQFjACegQIAhAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.modelsforchange.net%2Fpublications%2F852%2FAdolescent_Legal_Competence_in_Court.pdf"

				<h3 id="r">Risk-Needs Assessment and Case Planning</h3>
				<h4>Stakeholder Orientation Training</h4>
				<p>NYSAP can provide a 45 minute to 1.5 hour orientation for stakeholder groups &#40;including probation officers and related staff, judges, attorneys, service providers, and administrators&#41; that covers the research evidence for
					risk-needs assessment and risk-need-responsivity, strategies for implementing this process with success, and facilitators and barriers to implementation. </p>
				<h4>Risk-Needs Assessment Training</h4>
				<p>NYSAP provides 2-day workshops for end users about how to administer specific risk-needs assessment instruments. Each workshop covers the following content: adolescent development and its association with trajectories of offending,
					research support for the instrument, risk-need responsivity, the agency’s policies for administration and use of the instrument, interviewing, scoring procedures and practice cases. In addition, NYSAP uses post-training practice cases to
					assess each end user’s proficiency on the instrument. NYSAP provides these workshops for the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="yls.html" target="_blank" title="YLS/CMI" alt="go to page">Youth Level of Service / Case Management Inventory &#40;Hoge &amp; Andrews, 2011&#41;</a></li>
					<li><a href="savry.html" title="SAVRY" alt="go to page" target="_blank">Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth &#40;Borum, Bartel, &amp; Forth, 2006&#41;.</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Case Planning Training</h4>
				<p>NYSAP provides a 1.5 day training for end users about how to conduct case planning after working with agencies to customize their case plan template to be consistent with their risk-needs assessment, risk-need-responsivity (linking case
					plans to their risk-needs assessment), and best practices in juvenile justice (e.g., family engagement). In addition, NYSAP uses post-training practice cases to assess each end user’s proficiency on in case planning and linking the case
					planning to the assessment.</p>
				<h4>Interviewing Procedures</h4>
				<p>NYSAP provides a 2 to 2.5-hour training for risk-needs assessment end users in interviewing strategies for youth and their caregivers. The training includes skills for being a good interviewer, including how to create an atmosphere for
					gathering information and for being a good interviewer. This includes how to interview individuals remotely and role-playing to improve skill level in the interviewing process.</p>
				<h4>Train the Trainer Options</h4>
				<p>NYSAP works with agencies to a&#41; select agency trainers, and b&#41; develop the best train the trainer strategy for the agency &#40;e.g., after training trainers observe them conducting live trainings with staff, set up a remote
					training option where the staff trainer trains NYSAP consultants&#41;. NYSAP trains these advanced staff persons in how to train on both the specific risk-needs assessment instrument &#40;if it is the YLS/CMI or SAVRY&#41; and in case
					planning.</p>
				<h4>Supervisor Training</h4>
				<p>NYSAP provides a 3 to 3.5 hour training for supervisors of end-users of risk-needs assessment and case planning. The training includes developing strategies for effective quality assurance and continuous quality improvement by supervisors.
					This includes what to look for when evaluating whether the end users are completing the assessment with fidelity and proficiency and whether they are developing and utilizing case plans in a meaningful way. Developing a booster training
					framework, along with a coaching model will be discussed. </p>
