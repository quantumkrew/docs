                <h2>Behavioral Health Screening and Assessment</h2>
                <h3>NYSAP Consultation and Training</h3>
                <p>Engaging adolescents in evidence-based screening for behavioral health needs at system-contact has become standard practice nationwide. System-contact includes a diverse array of settings including: diversion programs, juvenile probation, juvenile detention, and residential placements &#40;e.g., non-secure and secure programs&#41;. Identifying young person’s behavioral health needs—mental health, substance use, trauma symptoms and related problems, and suicide ideation—is important at initial system contact. Behavioral health screening is the first step for identifying those adolescents who need immediate attention and further assessment for behavioral health needs.</p>
                <p>NYSAP has the experience and expertise to assist you in selecting and putting in place behavioral health screening and assessment tools in juvenile diversion, probation, detention, and residential programs. We’ve been consulted by juvenile justice programs throughout the U.S. for 20 years. We know how to help you decide what’s best for you and the young people you work with.
