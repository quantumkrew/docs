                                                <p>First, the recommended time for giving the MAYSI-2 in detention is within a few hours after youths have been admitted. Typically the best time is 2 to 4 hours after admission. Why is that? While observing detention centers nationwide, we've learned that the first hour typically is occupied with a variety of identification and health screening questions, safety issues, detention pod assignments, description of the rules, and so forth. Putting a youth in front of the MAYSI-2 in this relatively intense and sometimes chaotic event probably is not the best time for thoughtful answers to questions about one’s feelings and behaviors. A good time for the MAYSI-2 is right at the end of that process—perhaps when a youth has been assigned to a pod, has seen where he or she will be tonight, and is able to take a deep breath. Waiting much beyond 2 to 4 hours after admission to the facility, however, runs risks of a youth having an important emergency mental health need that goes undetected until the youth actually acts out that need.</p>
                                                <p>Similarly, detention policy should address whether young people who are merely being transported from one detention center to another need to be administered the MAYSI-2 on the second admission. One might think that it would do little harm. But there is some evidence that youths can get the MAYSI-2 too often—that is, their answers change when they receive it over and over in a short period of time. Moreover, usually the previous placement will know of the youth’s special mental health needs and can inform the receiving placement about them—e.g., putting them on alert regarding past suicide risk status which many detention centers would want to reinstate upon a youth’s movement to any new setting.</p>
                                                <p>Finally, exceptions are often made for the youth who is being admitted to a detention center during the hours after midnight and before the first day shift. Fatigue associated with that time of night might influence you youths’ respond to a screening tool.</p>

                                        <p>Does the SI scale predict future suicide attempts? </p>

                                        <p>We do not know how well the SI scale (or any other scale) <span class="bolditalic">predicts</span> suicidal behavior. In fact, this may never be known. When a youth obtains a high score on a suicide potential scale, it would be unethical to simply stand by and watch to see if the youth attempts suicide. One must intervene to prevent a suicidal behavior from occurring, and therefore one can never know whether the scale “accurately” predicted suicide. For this reason, truly predictive studies for any suicide potential scale are quite rare. However, there have been two studies that have examined the relation of suicidal behavior to SI scale scores on the MAYSI-2 when youths enter juvenile justice facilities. Both of them examined past suicide attempts. One found a significantly higher prevalence of past suicide attempts (recent and lifetime) or past suicidal thoughts, for youths scoring above the SI Caution cutoff at intake. This suggests that the SI scale has value in helping to identify youths whose histories of past suicide attempts—often not known to staff at intake—indicating that they are at higher risk for future suicide attempts. Current evidence indicates that the SI scale is valid for this purpose.</p>

                                            A common concern of many programs that use brief screening instruments is what test developers call “false positives.” An instrument’s cut-off score on a good suicide screening scale might identify most of the youths who are really at risk, but in doing so, it might also identify many youths who score above the cut-off yet are not seriously suicidal. This is a problem because when youths are over the cut-off score on a MAYSI-2 scale, such as Suicide Ideation, many juvenile facilities place all of these youth on suicide watch or refer them for costly clinical evaluations.</p>

                                                <p>We’ve often been asked by MAYSI-2 users whether there is a way to reduce “false positives,” thereby reducing the number and additional cost of those unnecessary clinical referrals. There is. You can instruct staff members who give the MAYSI-2 to ask two or three follow-up questions whenever a youth scores above the Caution or Warning cut-off on a scale. (Some programs do this just for two or three scales they are most concerned about—for example, Suicide Ideation, Depressed-Anxious, and/or Thought Disturbance.) Typically this is done immediately after scoring the MAYSI-2, and before deciding what response to make in terms of referral or further evaluation. For example, imagine that a youth answers “yes” to two or three of the Suicide Ideation items, putting her over the Warning cut-off. Sometimes this happens because the youth was feeling that way sometime in the past few weeks (as suggested by the MAYSI-2 instructions), rather than right now. Simply asking a follow-up question about whether she feels that way now, or whether she said “yes” to the item because she felt that way some time in the past, helps staff to make a judgment about whether the threat at the moment is serious. One should not ignore the youth’s report that she felt that way in the past and not now. But knowing this helps one to decide whether or not a suicide watch, for example, is needed at the moment.</p>

                                                <p>The MAYSI-2 manual includes a set of “Second Screening” forms for each of the MAYSI-2 scales. These provide questions that staff can ask to follow up on youths’ MAYSI-2 responses in the manner described in the above example.</p>
                                                <p>Another scale on which Second Screening is often important is Thought Disturbance. When you ask some youths about their high scores on Thought Disturbance items about “seeing things others don’t see,” sometimes second screening reveals that they meant “when I am high.” This may indicate a problem—drug use—but suggests a lower likelihood that they are referring to hallucinations related to thought disturbance.</p>

                                    </dt>
                                    <dd class="col-sm-8">
                                        <p>We are often asked whether the MAYSI-2 is appropriate for use with youths in programs and facilities that are not part of the juvenile justice system—for example, child mental health clinics, community substance use programs, or public school counseling services. There are several reasons that we hesitate to recommend the MAYSI-2 for those settings.</p>

                                        <p>First, the MAYSI-2 was normed on youths in juvenile justice facilities, so that we do not know whether the “cut-off scores” on the MAYSI-2 would have the same meaning with different groups of youths in other settings. Second, the value of MAYSI-2 screening in clinical settings is usually less than in juvenile justice settings. The MAYSI-2 was designed for use especially by non-clinicians to decide which youths to refer for assessment of possible mental health problems. In contrast, we presume that when youths enter clinical settings, there is less need for a tool that determines whether they have mental health problems. Typically they do (or they would not have gotten there). Moreover, unlike many juvenile justice settings, clinical settings have clinicians at the front door who assess every youth, so that there is little need in clinical settings for a screening tool to determine whether a youth needs to be assessed.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, there are far better instruments than the MAYSI-2 for the more focused screening sometimes required in clinical settings (e.g., specifically for substance abuse or for trauma). Although some of these focused screens are used in juvenile justice settings, usually they have been developed with child clinical populations specifically for use in community clinical settings.

                                        <p><strong>No. </strong>Do not install MAYSIWARE onto your server and try to get other computers to connect to the software. MAYSIWARE was designed to function as a local database and for all data to remain on the local database. If you attempt to put MAYSIWARE on a server, this will cause problems with MAYSIWARE. If you do attempt to do this, we will not be able to offer you technical assistance; you will need to resolve the problems that arise on your own. So, please install MAYSIWARE as specified in the MAYSIWARE User's Guide, meaning install on each computer and network them locally through MAYSIWARE if you wish to do so. MAYSIWARE acts as its own local database server. You must install MAYSIWARE on all computers and if you wish to localy network them (within 1 physical building), one of the computers must act as a "server" and the others will act as "clients". Please see the MAYSIWARE User's Guide for further instructions. </p>

                                        <p><strong>No. </strong>MAYSIWARE can only be networked locally, within a physical building. We designed the software so it would function as a local database for a variety of reasons. We realize that some agencies may be disappointed by this, but if you want to analyze data from all of your state facilities at a later date, it is really easy to do so. All you need to do is have each facility click on the export data option and the data can be exported into an SPSS or Excel file. The data will be formatted and coded. The facility can also select what data to export, but the name and DOB will stripped from the exported data. Each facility can then e-mail the file to the state agency and the state agency can easily combine all the files from each facility as they will all have the same data fields and be formatted in the same way. The state facility can then easily analyze the data. Another option is that the facilities can print out their site norms and then send these to the state agency and the state agency can look at the site norms for each facility.</p>
